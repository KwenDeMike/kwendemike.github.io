					<h1>Michaël Koene</h1>
					<p>Hello, my name is Michaël Koene. I'm 40 years old (very very soon) and I live in Liège.</p>
					<p>I share my life with my wife and my 3 children. My taller child is a girl named Iris, she is 9 years old. My son's name is Victor and is 7 years old. The last but not least, my second daughter is called Camille and is 5 years old.</p>
					<p>I love discovering new technologies, seeing how progress is developped in the world and imagining what our futur could be with all these innovations.</p>
					<p>I like video games. Whether playing them or even watching them being played by others on Twitch.</p>
					<p>I like sports too. I play futsal and manage my own club with two adult teams, one for men and one for women.</p>
					<p>You can find out more about this sport in <a href='hobby.html'>My Hobby</a> page.</p>
