					<h1>Playing</h1>
					<p>I have been playing futsal since I was 6 years old. I can play as a field player or as a goalkeeper, I don't really have a preference.
						I also played football for a long time but these sports are as different as complementary.</p>
					<p>The biggest difference between these two sports is the size of the field. When we play football, we have a very large field.
						So we can use our speed to dribble past a player even if we are not good with the ball. We can simply push the ball and run faster than our opponent for several meters.</p>
					<p>When we play futsal we don't have this possibility, so the technique with the ball is more important.
						Since there are fewer dribbling opportunities, team play is also very important.</p>
					<p>Unlike football where we play with a team of 11 players, in futsal we only play with 5 players by team.
						Since we have fewer dribbling opportunities, less space on the pitch and fewer teammates, the key to futsal is movement and explosiveness.</p>
					<p>This is why this sport is more spectacular and has less downtime than its cousin football.</p>

					<h1>Coaching</h1>
					<p>Last year I decided to start my own futsal club. Having started coaching young boys aged 5-6 two years ago has taught me that I enjoy teaching others and managing a team.</p>
					<p>So I created a futsal team and over time I noticed enthusiasm and a strong demand for a women's team.
						Before the start of the season, I also decided to create this team and the club has now 2 teams.</p>
					<p>I play on the men's team and coach the women's team. The pleasure is totally different but just as great.
						Coaching is more a question of explanations, humans relations, detection of the strength and weakness of each player, ...</p>
					<p>As I don't like doing things without knowledge, I took coaching courses with <a href='https://www.sport-adeps.be' target="_blank">Adeps</a>.
						I have almost 4 certificates on football and futsal training (1 of which is in progress).</p>

					<h1>Managing</h1>
					<p>Running a club takes a lot of time but I try to do my best by doing it professionally even though it is an amateur club.</p>
					<p>I created a <a href='https://www.fut-event.be' target="_blank">website</a> to display all the information about the club, the teams, the sponsors, ...
						and also allow players to manage their availability for each match or training.</p>
					<p>I also manage the team's social network with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FUT.Event.Team" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page.</p>
					<p>I try to take as much responsibility as possible in the management of the club so
						that the players can concentrate on the pleasure of practicing their favorite sport.</p>
					<p>Hope you enjoyed this topic. Let's finish by taking a look at the fake <a href='reviews.html'>Reviews</a> of myself.</p>
